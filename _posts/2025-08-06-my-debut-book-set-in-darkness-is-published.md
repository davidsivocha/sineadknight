I’m excited to announce that my debut book, _Set in Darkness_, is being released on Amazon on **14th September 2025**. Pre-orders for the e-book are available now! You can find it [here](https://books2read.com/u/3LM6rJ)!

More details about the book:

> When his lie is whispered into the ears of another, Leander, the God of Lies, shatters Prince Jarryn’s world. Condemned to mortality until he can atone for his crime, Leander must face the weight of his past deeds and confront the repercussions of his lies while seeking to mend the fractured lives he has left in his wake.
>
> But, despite how the fallen demigod feels, the path before him is not his to walk alone. As war brews on all fronts, more than just Leander and Jarryn are affected by the treacherous lie. In the chaotic brewing war, where gods and mortals must choose their sides, Leander's true redemption will cost more than making amends for his past sins. It may cost his heart.
