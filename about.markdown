Sinéad Knight is a writer-by-night kind of girl, with a full time job that keeps her busy during the day. Falling in love with the power of words from a young age, she studied Linguistics at university and went on to make communication her career. When she is not weaving magic with her words, you can find Sinéad indulging in her favourite pastimes of reading, crochet, and painting.

She lives in the UK with her military-serving husband, and three fluff-balls who enjoy sitting on her and stopping her from doing anything productive.
